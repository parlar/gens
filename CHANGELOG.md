This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/)

About changelog [here](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)

## TBD

### Added

- Generate the frontend's `Api*` types from the API's own OpenAPI schema (`npm run types:api`), with `npm run types:api:check` failing in CI when they go stale

### Changed

- Let the CI typecheck and ESLint jobs fail a pull request instead of only reporting; both already pass on `dev`

### Fixed

- Stop writing a BAF of zero for positions where nothing was measured: a no-call or a position below the requested depth is now omitted rather than plotted at the same height as a position with no alt allele
- Keep gVCF reference blocks that report `MIN_DP` instead of `DP`, which the depth filter previously read as depth zero
- Reject an empty sample annotation replacement before deleting the existing records, so a file that parses to nothing no longer empties the track
- Refuse to start with an empty or whitespace `SECRET_KEY` when authentication is enabled; an unset environment variable arrives as an empty string, which the previous check let through
- Pass `SECRET_KEY` through in `docker-compose.yml` and document providing it, so the documented `docker compose up -d` path starts again
- Run the shared API authentication dependency and the protected docs handlers in the threadpool instead of on the event loop, where their session lookup blocked every other request
- Compare the read-connections window inclusively in the frontend, matching the route, instead of sending the one boundary window the server rejects
- Send the annotation track id as `track_id` from the sample annotation tracks endpoint too, instead of `_id`, so the two sibling endpoints agree and the published schema describes what is actually sent
- Show a variant's allele depths in its tooltip: they were read from a `sample` field the API does not return, so the row was always empty
- Stop the variant tooltip throwing when the viewed sample has no genotype call on that variant
- Publish `cadd_score`, `cytoband_start`, `cytoband_end` and the per-sample genotype call fields in the variant schema, which `extra="allow"` had let through undeclared
- Reject the default `secret_key` when authentication is enabled, since the published default lets anyone forge a session cookie for an existing user
- Apply the configured session lifetime when authenticating API requests, so expired session cookies are no longer accepted there
- Embed the samples JSON directly instead of inside a JavaScript template literal, preventing a stored case ID from executing script on the samples page
- Discard stale data track responses before updating the cached render data, so a slow request can no longer redraw another region's data
- Validate replacement annotations before deleting the existing track, so a file that parses to no records no longer orphans the previously loaded annotations
- Handle haploid genotypes (`GT=0`, `GT=1`) when calculating BAF instead of raising `ValueError`
- Use a consistent BED to genomic coordinate conversion when reading coverage and BAF, removing a parity dependent off-by-one in reported positions
- URL encode query parameters with `URLSearchParams`, so sample identifiers containing `&`, `+` or `#` are no longer corrupted or truncated
- Clamp panning to the first base of a chromosome and tolerate positions matching no cytogenetic band
- Accept the standard BED `255,0,0` itemRgb colour format in addition to `rgb(255,0,0)`

## 4.6.2

### Changed

- Allow configuring the Flask session and remember-me cookie names with `session_cookie_name` and `remember_cookie_name` to avoid cookie collisions when Gens shares a host with other Flask apps. - [#733](https://github.com/SMD-Bioinformatics-Lund/gens/pull/733)

## 4.6.1

### Fixed

- Fix such that cancer cases (as indicated by sample type "tumor" or "normal") queries Scout for "cancer_sv" variants instead of "sv" [#726](https://github.com/SMD-Bioinformatics-Lund/gens/pull/726)

## 4.6.0

### Added

- Setting "Screenshot display names" (under "settings -> advanced settings") allowing users to temporarily change case and sample IDs for screenshots [#709](https://github.com/SMD-Bioinformatics-Lund/gens/pull/709)
- Check existing settings in profile JSON, giving a clear console error message if the profile contains unexpected fields [#722](https://github.com/SMD-Bioinformatics-Lund/gens/pull/722)
- Login expire duration can now be configured through the config setting "login_session_lifetime" [#723](https://github.com/SMD-Bioinformatics-Lund/gens/pull/723)

### Changed

- Allow skipping the trailing "/" for the API URL in the config file [#720](https://github.com/SMD-Bioinformatics-Lund/gens/pull/720)
- Marker regions have edges. This means that even if zooming far in, a user will still get an indication in the overview plot of where one is looking [#721](https://github.com/SMD-Bioinformatics-Lund/gens/pull/721)
- The case linkout in the track view is shown as a linkout icon instead of a clickable URL  [#721](https://github.com/SMD-Bioinformatics-Lund/gens/pull/721)

### Fixed

- Update GitHub workflow action versions and fix Dockerfile paths [#702](https://github.com/SMD-Bioinformatics-Lund/gens/pull/702)
- Workaround to fix unmigrated legacy strand type in genomic features [#703](https://github.com/SMD-Bioinformatics-Lund/gens/pull/703)
- Mark API URL safe for html use [#705](https://github.com/SMD-Bioinformatics-Lund/gens/pull/705)
- Make sure absolute samples use absolute path [#709](https://github.com/SMD-Bioinformatics-Lund/gens/pull/709)
- Fix such that all `--genome-build` CLI inputs also allow the shorthand `-b` flag [#709](https://github.com/SMD-Bioinformatics-Lund/gens/pull/709)
- Prompt the user before overwriting sample annotations [#709](https://github.com/SMD-Bioinformatics-Lund/gens/pull/709)

## 4.5.0

### Added

- Track highlight is a multiselect, meaning that multiple annotation sources can be used for track highlights. [#686](https://github.com/SMD-Bioinformatics-Lund/gens/pull/686)
- Load a full case from a yaml file. [#692](https://github.com/SMD-Bioinformatics-Lund/gens/pull/692)

- Add support for using a user db+collection from the variant software. This would allow for instance a user running a Scout setup to check that users exists in that db rather than in the Gens db, omitting the need to keep the same users in both. [#698](https://github.com/SMD-Bioinformatics-Lund/gens/pull/698)

- Overview chart labels display for all chromosomes 1-22, X, Y, not only those present in the data. [#685](https://github.com/SMD-Bioinformatics-Lund/gens/pull/685)
- Remove support from using overview JSONs. The overview is now retrieved from the "o" level in the tabix files. [#692](https://github.com/SMD-Bioinformatics-Lund/gens/pull/692)
- Refactor db usage in backend to use a single access point, to simplify both CLI code and unit tests. [#692](https://github.com/SMD-Bioinformatics-Lund/gens/pull/692)
- Move user management from API to CLI. [#697](https://github.com/SMD-Bioinformatics-Lund/gens/pull/697)

- Profile should now reset when profile version is updated. [#686](https://github.com/SMD-Bioinformatics-Lund/gens/pull/686)
- Clear user error message when attempting to opening a sample from a build for which chromosomes haven't been loaded. [#690](https://github.com/SMD-Bioinformatics-Lund/gens/pull/690)
- Fix such that the same case ID can be reused across different builds. [#691](https://github.com/SMD-Bioinformatics-Lund/gens/pull/691)
- Fix latent race condition when adding new samples, which could yield tracks that did not respond to expanding. [#691](https://github.com/SMD-Bioinformatics-Lund/gens/pull/691)
- Fix such that only samples from the relevant build are displayed in the "add samples" dropdown. [#691](https://github.com/SMD-Bioinformatics-Lund/gens/pull/691)

### Fixed

- Chromosome does not respond to zooming in the track view (https://github.com/SMD-Bioinformatics-Lund/gens/pull/561).

- Intron numbering OK also for reverse strand transcripts (https://github.com/SMD-Bioinformatics-Lund/gens/pull/539)
- Boxpadding for sample info drawer, to prevent truncating at the bottom (https://github.com/SMD-Bioinformatics-Lund/gens/pull/539)
- Fix such that the same Gens port is used for dev and prod configs (5000), avoiding having to reconfigure during release testing (https://github.com/SMD-Bioinformatics-Lund/gens/pull/544)
- A change in annotation db does no longer crash the load due to expecting pre-selected annotations to be there. These preselections are instead dropped with a (console) warning. (https://github.com/SMD-Bioinformatics-Lund/gens/pull/548)
- When pressing shift or control, the cursor immediately switches to zoom indication (https://github.com/SMD-Bioinformatics-Lund/gens/pull/549)
