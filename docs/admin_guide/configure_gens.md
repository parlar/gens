# Configuration of Gens

Gens can be configured using environment variables, a dotfile or with a separate toml file. To use a custom toml, specify the path to the file with the environment variable CONFIG_FILE.

The configs are read in the following priority order,

1.	Environment variables
2.	Dotfile
3.	Custom toml
4.	Default configuration (stored in config.toml)

Example of how to use environment variables in combination with docker.

```yaml
services:
  gens:
    environment:
      - GENS_DB__CONNECTION=mongodb://mongodb:27017/gens
```

Example of how-to setup Gens with a custom configuration in a docker environment.

```yaml
services:
  gens:
    environment:
      - CONFIG_FILE=/home/worker/user.conf.toml
    volumes:
      - ./user.conf.toml:/home/worker/user.conf.toml
```

### Example config file

```
variant_url = "http://localhost:8000/scout"
authentication = "oauth"
auth_user_db = "gens"
# auth_user_collection = "user"
gens_api_url = "http://localhost:5000/api"
main_sample_types = ["proband", "tumor"]
session_cookie_name = "gens_session"
remember_cookie_name = "gens_remember_me"

[gens_db]
connection = "mongodb://mongodb:27017/gens"

[variant_db]
connection = "mongodb://mongodb:27017/scout"

[oauth]
client_id = "gens"
secret = "secret"
discovery_url = "https://oidc.example.org/.well-known/openid-configuration"

[default_profile_paths]
"proband+relative" = "profiles/proband_relative.json"
```

## Options

Configuration options. Note that double underscores (`__`) are used to denote sub-categories, such as **gens_db** and **oauth**, when using environment variables. For example, the environment variable name for configuring Gens mongodb connection is `GENS_DB__CONNECTION` (`<SUB-CATEGORY>__<VARIABLE>`).

- **variant_url**, base URL to Scout.
- **authentication**, authentication method "oauth", "ldap", "simple", "disabled"
- **auth_user_db**, database used for login user lookups: "gens" (default) or "variant" (Scout db via `variant_db` config)
- **auth_user_collection**, collection used for login user lookups (default: "user")
- **gens_api_url**, base URL for the Gens API (for example `http://localhost:5000/api/`)
- **main_sample_types**, sample types handled as the "main" sample for multi-sample cases. I.e. the sample displayed in the overview plot and multi-chromosome view.
- **session_cookie_name**, Flask session cookie name (default: `gens_session`). Set this to an app-specific value when multiple Flask apps share the same host.
- **remember_cookie_name**, Flask-Login remember cookie name (default: `gens_remember_me`). Set this to an app-specific value when multiple Flask apps share the same host.
- **default_profile_paths**, mapping from profile type to default profile JSON. Profile types are calculated by the unique and sorted `sample_type` values joined by `+`. Values are paths to JSON files relative to the config file.

`authentication = "simple"` requires users to log in with email only. Access is granted only if that email exists in the configured auth user database/collection. Only meant to use for testing.

### Who can see what

Gens checks **who you are**, not **what you may look at**. Once a user is
logged in they can read every sample, every case and every annotation track in
the database. There is no per-user, per-case or per-institute restriction, and
the `roles` field on a user record is stored but never consulted — an `admin`
role grants nothing that a `user` role does not.

This matters most when authentication is backed by a directory. Configuring
OAuth or LDAP decides *which* accounts can log in; it does not carry any
group or attribute from that directory into what Gens shows them. A person who
can log in can see every patient in the instance.

So the set of accounts that can authenticate **is** the access control list.
Before exposing an instance, decide whether everyone in that set is meant to
see every sample it holds. If they are not, run separate instances with
separate databases, since Gens has no way to divide one.

With `authentication = "disabled"` there is no boundary at all: anyone who can
reach the port can read everything. Keep such an instance on a machine only you
can reach, or behind an SSH tunnel.

**gens_db**

- **connection**, mongodb conneciton string
- **database**, optional database name. Can also be in connection string

**variant_db**

- **connection**, mongodb connection string
- **database**, optional database name. Can also be in connection string

**ldap**

- **server**, LDAP server URL such as `ldap://ldap.example.com`
- **bind_user_template**, template used to bind directly to the LDAP server. Supported placeholders are `{username}` / `{email}` (full login value) and `{uid}` / `{localpart}` (substring before `@`).
  For email-based login where LDAP DN uses `uid`, use:
  `uid={uid},ou=people,dc=example,dc=com`

## User management CLI

Use the CLI to manage users in the Gens user collection:

```bash
# List users
gens users list

# Create user
gens users create --email user@example.com --name "Example User"

# Show one user
gens users show --email user@example.com

# Delete user
gens users delete --email user@example.com --force
```
